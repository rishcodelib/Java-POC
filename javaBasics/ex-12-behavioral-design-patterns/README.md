## Behavior Design Patterns

1. **Chain of Responsibility** : Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
2. **Command** : Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
3. **Interpreter** : Implements a specialized language.
4. **Iterator** :Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
5. **Mediator** : Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
6. **Memento** : Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
7. **Observer** : Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
8. **State** : Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
9. **Strategy** : Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
10. **Template Method** : Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
11. **Visitor** : Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
