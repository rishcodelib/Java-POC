Composite Design Pattern: Structural Design Pattern

Used:

Whenever we have a tree structure of objects, and that object internally have multiple objects
Opetations performed on leaf node, the same operations should be performed on Composite object as well.

Graph:

                      Composite Object
                      /           \
              Cabinet              Periphiral Devices
              /      \                  /           \
  Hard-Drive    Mother Board        Keyboard       Mouse (Leaf node)
                  /       \
                RAM       CPU (Leaf Node)
