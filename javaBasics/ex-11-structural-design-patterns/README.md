## Structural Design Patterns

1. **Adapter** : Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.
2. **Bridge** : Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
3. **Composite** : Takes a group of objects into a single object.
4. **Decorator** : Allows for an objectâ€™s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
5. **Facade** : Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
6. **Flyweight** : Reduces the cost of complex object models.
7. **Proxy** : Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.
